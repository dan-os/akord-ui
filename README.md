# React Native Component Library

This is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) project built with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and [React Native Reusables](https://reactnativereusables.com).

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run storybook
```

This will start the Storybook Dev Server.
## Adding components

You can add more reusable components using the CLI:

```bash
# note: use pnpm equivalent
npx react-native-reusables/cli@latest add [...components]
```

> e.g. `npx react-native-reusables/cli@latest add input textarea`

If you don't specify any component names, you'll be prompted to select which components to add interactively. Use the `--all` flag to install all available components at once.
